				<p>Journalists and lawyers often talk about FOI laws, but just about anyone can learn to use them effectively.
				Each state, territory and the Commonwealth of Australia has its own freedom of information legislation.</p> 
				<p>The laws have been around since the 1980s, and were designed to make government decisions and the workings of the public service more transparent for ordinary Australians.

	<!--This is where the text picks up again-->
	<p>FOI simply refers to the process of requesting specific documents held by any of the thousands of government agencies across Australia (with some exceptions, like ASIO).</p>
				<p>This could be anything from your own medical records held by the Department of Health, to emails send between two cabinet ministers about what they had for lunch.</p>
				<p>There are rules about what you can request, but mainly they boil down to whether or not the documents exist (ie. fishing expeditions rarely work).</p>
				<p>Most requests will take around a month to process, and sometimes can be refused for various reasons. In most cases, you can appeal these decisions all the way up to the High Court.<p>
