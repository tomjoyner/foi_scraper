  <div class="container-department-narrow">
  <p>The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is a central department of state with broad ranging responsibilities, primarily intergovernmental and whole-of-government policy coordination and assisting the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.</p>
    <p>The Department also assists in handling FOI requests made to the office of the Prime Minister as well as other Cabinet ministers, however the final decision for such requests rests with the relevent minister themselves.</p>
    <p>Given ministers' busy schedule, it is common for them to delegate this responsibility to their chief of staff or other senior staffer in their office. This can lead to problems as staffers are not FOI professionals nor public servants, and foremost serve the intersts of their boss, not government transparency.</p>
    <p>To make an FOI request to this department, contact the FOI officer at <a href="mailto:foi@pmc.gov.au">foi@pmc.gov.au</a>.</p>
