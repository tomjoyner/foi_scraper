  <!--This is where the Department Description goes-->
  <div class="container-department-narrow">
  <p>The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is the central department of the public service primarily responsible for coordinating policy across the entire government as well as assisting the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.</p>
    <p>The Department also assists in handling FOI requests made to the Prime Minister and other Cabinet ministers, however it is the ministers' offices who make the final decision for such requests.</p>
    <p>Given ministers' busy schedules, it is common for them to delegate this responsibility to their chief of staff or another senior staffer in their office. This can lead to a conflict of interest as staffers are not FOI professionals nor public servants, and foremost serve the interests of their boss, not government transparency.</p>
